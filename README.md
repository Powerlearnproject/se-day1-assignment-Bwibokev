# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.
Being that it involves creating softwares that can be used in customer facing, medical rsearch and institutional puposes
I believe its a key component in economic boost, customer satisfaction and better equipoped learning foir students.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
First computer program -the first computer program called the A-0 system programming
The birth of software engineering in 1970s - creation of first software engineering curriculum
The rise of software development methodologist - software engineers began to formal methodologies for software development
The personal computer revolution -microsoft tools such as excel and word being credted on operating systems,

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning and requirement analysis - this includes taking surveys from the users intended
Defining requirements - All requirements for the target software are specified and get approved by customers analysts and stakeholders
Developing Product - fundamental development of the product starts using a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS.
Designing architecture - coming up with the right architect for the software (DDS)
Product testing and Integration

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfal model outlines a linear approach to software development while Agile emphasizes collaborationa and flexibility.
The former woyuld be better for personal projects before being intended to the public while the later is best suited for cross projects
among peers and leaders.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
QA Engineer - monitor every phase of software development process
Software developer- Designs build sand mantains software applications,
Project manager - Organizes software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to specifications of a task.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Streamelined workflow -IDEs uses or rather combines various tools  like code editors, compilers, debuggers, and build automation into a single interface eliminating the need to
switch between multiple applications and streamlining the development process,
Collaboration- VCS makes it possible for the multiple developers to work on the same database simultaneously without overwriting eachother's changes by using branching and merging features,

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Its a process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intellgence model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
